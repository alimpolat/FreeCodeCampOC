## Getting Started with Node.js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side Web applications. 

Simply [download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install the package for your operating system. To check if you have node installed, for Windows open the Windows Command Prompt, and for Mac open up Terminal and type:
```
node -v 
```
This should print the version number so something like this would show up:
```
v4.4.0
```
Congrats! You now have Node.js installed. Now you can browse the [NPM website](https://www.npmjs.com/) for packages and install awesome ones such as the GitHub [Markdown Preview](https://github.com/revolunet/sublimetext-markdown-preview).
